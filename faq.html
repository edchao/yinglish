    <div class="row question">
      <p>What is your background?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row answer">
      <p>I am a native English speaker based out of the San Francisco Bay Area. I have a dual degree in Sociology and Spanish from a top American liberal arts college, and over 10+ years working in marketing, with a focus on the healthcare and med device industries. However, I have a broad background that spans the life sciences, computer science and UX design, which enables me to review English writing for a variety of fields. I also previously taught GMAT and GRE classes for a major educational training provider in my spare time. I have two young children, one older dog, and a passion for travel, languages and hiking.</p>

    <div class="row question">
      <p>Are you currently accepting new files?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row answer">
      <p>You can check my availability <a href="/schedule.html">here.</a></p>
    </div>

    <div class="row question">
      <p>What kind of files do you accept?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row answer">
      <p>I can review almost any type of paper in English, from application documents and resumes to theses, journal submissions, recommendation letters, portfolios and presentations, as long as the content can be placed in an MS Word document for review.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row question">
      <p>How do I pay?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row answer">
      <p>After you agree to the price, I will send a bill through PayPal (it will come from “Kuen-ru Lin). I currently only accept payment through PayPal. If you have a PayPal account, you can pay via money transfer. If you do not have a PayPal account, you can pay by credit card without registering for an account.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row question">
      <p>How quickly will I receive my edited files(s)?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row answer">
      <p>You will receive them some time within 72 or 24 hours from the time that you agree to the exact price. Weekends are included in the timeline, so if you agree to the 72-hour price of a file on Friday at 9am, you will receive it by Monday at 9am.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row question">
      <p>What if I need my paper sooner?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row answer">
      <p>If you need your paper sooner than within 24 hours, I will need to confirm whether I can finish on time. The rush price is usually $0.10/word or more if I am available.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row question">
      <p>What does your editing service include?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row answer">
      <p>I will check the grammar, structure and word choice. If something is not culturally appropriate, I will also refine or remove it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row question">
      <p>Does the price include multiple revisions?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row answer">
      <p>No. If you need me to re-review the file, there will likely be a fee. However, if you have questions, or only need me to check a few sentences, you are welcome to ask at no charge.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row question">
      <p>Do I need to pay for the entire file if you have reviewed part of it before? </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row answer">
      <p>No. Just use a different color to show the text I need to edit, and let me know how many words I need to review. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="row question">
      <p>What is the best way to contact you?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row answer">
      <p>Since I am based in Silicon Valley, California and there is a significant time difference with Asia, email is the best way to reach me.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row question">
      <p>Can I communicate with you in Chinese?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row answer">
      <p>Yes, but I will usually respond more quickly in English, particularly for any questions after I’ve edited a paper. I’m a native English speaker but not a native Chinese speaker, so I read Chinese much more slowly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row question">
      <p>Do you accept translation cases?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row answer">
      <p>Occasionally. Since I’m not a native Chinese speaker, I need to first confirm that my Chinese is sufficient for the requested content. If it is, the price is usually $0.10/word within 72 hours, or $0.12/word within 24 hours.</p>
